# ✅ Firebase Credentials - Setup Complete

**Date**: October 20, 2025
**Status**: ✅ **SECURED & READY FOR DEPLOYMENT**

---

## What We Did

### 1. ✅ Secured Your Firebase Credentials

Your Firebase admin service account key is now properly secured:

- **File Location**: `deadline-capstone-firebase-adminsdk-fbsvc-8efd8ef2a7.json`
- **Git Protection**: ✅ Already in `.gitignore` (won't be committed)
- **Local Setup**: ✅ `.env` configured to use the file
- **Backend Test**: ✅ Django successfully loads credentials

### 2. ✅ Configured Local Development

Your `.env` file now points to the Firebase JSON file:

```bash
FIREBASE_CREDENTIALS_FILE=/Users/ozzy-mac/Projects/deadline/deadline-capstone-firebase-adminsdk-fbsvc-8efd8ef2a7.json
```

This means:

- ✅ Local backend can authenticate with Firebase
- ✅ No need to set individual environment variables
- ✅ Easier development workflow

### 3. ✅ Created Railway Deployment Script

**Automated Script**: `deploy-railway-secure.sh`

This script will:

1. Check prerequisites (Railway CLI, Firebase file)
2. Login to Railway
3. Create/link project
4. Add PostgreSQL database
5. **Automatically extract credentials from your JSON file**
6. Set all environment variables securely in Railway
7. Deploy your backend

**No manual copy-pasting of credentials needed!** 🎉

---

## 🚀 Ready to Deploy

### Quick Start (Automated - Recommended)

```bash
# From project root
cd /Users/ozzy-mac/Projects/deadline

# Run the secure deployment script
./deploy-railway-secure.sh
```

**That's it!** The script handles everything.

### What Happens During Deployment

```
1. Prerequisites Check ✅
   ├─ Railway CLI installed
   └─ Firebase JSON file exists

2. Railway Setup 🚂
   ├─ Login to Railway
   ├─ Create/link project "deadline-api"
   └─ Add PostgreSQL database

3. Credential Extraction 🔐
   ├─ Read Firebase JSON file
   ├─ Extract all required values
   └─ No manual copying needed!

4. Environment Variables 🔧
   ├─ SECRET_KEY (auto-generated)
   ├─ DEBUG=False
   ├─ FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID
   ├─ FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY
   ├─ FIREBASE_CLIENT_EMAIL
   ├─ FIREBASE_CLIENT_ID
   └─ FIREBASE_CLIENT_X509_CERT_URL

5. Deployment 🚀
   ├─ Push code to Railway
   ├─ Build Django app
   ├─ Run migrations
   └─ Start server

6. Get URL 🌐
   └─ Copy your Railway backend URL
```

**Time: ~10 minutes**

## 📋 Your Firebase Credentials

| Field            | Value                                                               |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Project ID**   | `deadline-capstone`                                                 |
| **Client Email** | `firebase-adminsdk-fbsvc@deadline-capstone.iam.gserviceaccount.com` |
| **Client ID**    | `112943741519226739568`                                             |
| **Private Key**  | ✅ Secured in JSON file                                              |

These will be automatically set as Railway environment variables by the deployment script.

## 🧪 Test Local Setup

Your backend should now work with Firebase authentication:

```bash
# Start backend
cd capstone-server
python3 manage.py runserver

# Test (in another terminal)
curl http://localhost:8000/api/v1/auth/demo/login/
```

You should see Firebase authentication working! ✅

---

## 🚀 Next Steps

### 1. Deploy Backend to Railway (~10 min)

```bash
./deploy-railway-secure.sh
```

### 2. Get Backend URL

After deployment completes:

- Railway dashboard will show your URL
- Copy it (e.g., `https://deadline-api-production.up.railway.app`)

### 3. Deploy Frontend to Vercel (~15 min)

```bash
cd capstone-client

# Install Vercel CLI
npm install -g vercel

# Deploy
vercel --prod

# Set environment variables
vercel env add NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL production
# Enter: https://YOUR-RAILWAY-URL.up.railway.app/api/v1

# Set Firebase credentials (from Firebase Console web app config)
vercel env add NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY production
vercel env add NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN production
vercel env add NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID production
vercel env add NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET production
vercel env add NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID production
vercel env add NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID production

# Redeploy with env vars
vercel --prod
```

### 4. Update CORS

```bash
cd capstone-server

# Add Vercel URL to allowed origins
railway variables set CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS="https://your-app.vercel.app"
railway variables set VERCEL_FRONTEND_URL="https://your-app.vercel.app"

# Redeploy
railway up
```

### 5. Add Vercel Domain to Firebase

1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com)
2. Authentication → Settings → Authorized domains
3. Add: `your-app.vercel.app`

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Backend won't start?

```bash
cd capstone-server
python3 manage.py check
railway logs
```

### Firebase not working?

**Check:**

1. JSON file exists at correct path
2. `.env` has correct `FIREBASE_CREDENTIALS_FILE` path
3. Run: `python3 manage.py check`

### Deployment fails?

**Check:**

1. Railway CLI installed: `railway --version`
2. Logged in: `railway login`
3. Firebase JSON file in correct location
4. Run deployment script again
